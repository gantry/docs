The **Features** tab in Gantry for Joomla gives you access to module-like features that enhance the look and functionality of your site. This includes things like the copyright notice at the bottom of the page, date display, and a place for you to put the **Google Analytics** code used to track analytical data for your site.

For WordPress, the equivalent tab is called **Gizmos**. Many of the features used in Joomla are represented by Widgets on WordPress. You can find out more about WordPress gizmos by visiting the [Gizmos guide](../gizmos).
