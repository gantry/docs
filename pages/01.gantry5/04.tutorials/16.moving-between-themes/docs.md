## Introduction

Sometimes, you want to move your existing layout and settings from one Gantry 5 theme to another. This is a relatively simple process thanks in large part to how Gantry 5 is designed.

The **Custom** folder is the basic concept of Gantry 5 where everything that gets stored after a user interaction: custom settings, custom layouts, and custom CSS all goes in that folder.

[ui-tabs position="top-left" active="0"]
[ui-tab title="Joomla"]

In Joomla, this directory is located in `/templates/THEME_NAME/custom/`.

[/ui-tab]
[ui-tab title="WordPress"]

In WordPress, this directory is located in `/wp-content/themes/THEME_NAME/custom/`.

[/ui-tab]
[ui-tab title="Grav"]

In Grav, this directory is located in `user/data/gantry5/themes/THEME_DIR/`.

This ensures that it can be easily backed up and never lost after updates. Because we use a flat-file approach for storing the data, it can easily get ported over to other instances, both between templates as well as between platforms.

The contents of the `/config` folder in particular is important when transferring configuration data between themes. This folder contains layout and assignments information for various outlines in your site.

! You may need to do some minor reconfiguration once you have moved the contents of this directory to your new theme's folder. For example, you might have certain particles or other elements that are supported on one theme and not on another.

! In the case of JOOMLA - Joomla keeps track of the templates (outlines) in it's database in a table called xxxx_template_styles so you also have to manually change this database table to reflect all the template IDs you have copied (no more, no less). This can be a complicated procedure and doing it incorrectly may irrepairably damage your site so always take a backup before undertaking such a change.
