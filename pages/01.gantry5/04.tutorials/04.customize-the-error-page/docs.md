The **Error** page is considered a **System Page** in Gantry 5, and editing it to meet your needs is as easy as switching outlines in the **Gantry Administrator**.

You don't have to create a separate **Error** outline. It's actually included in the core of Gantry with its own **layout**, **settings**, and **styles** options.

[ui-tabs position="top-left" active="0"]
[ui-tab title="Joomla"]

The first step to customizing this page is to access the Gantry administrator by navigating to **Admin → Extensions → Template Manager** and selecting your active Gantry 5 template. This will take you to the Gantry Administrator.

From there, you will need to select **Error** from the **Outlines** dropdown. Doing so loads the outline for the Error page, giving you access to its **Layout Manager**, **Settings**, and **Styles** administrative panels.
