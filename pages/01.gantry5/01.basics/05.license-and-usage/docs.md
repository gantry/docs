Please make sure you have read and understand the license and usage requirements before deploying a template based on Gantry Framework.

License
-------

Gantry Framework is free, and released under the [GPLv2.0 license][GPL]. The definition of this license as stated on [Wikipedia][wiki] is:

>>> The GPL is an example of a powerful copyleft license that requires derived works to be available under the same copyleft. Under this philosophy, the GPL grants the recipients of a computer program the rights of the free software definition and uses copyleft to ensure the freedoms are preserved, even when the work is changed or added to. This is in distinction to permissive free software licenses, of which the BSD licenses are the standard examples.


Usage
-----
You are free to use Gantry Framework for your personal and commercial projects. You do not have to keep the Gantry or RocketTheme links and logos in the front end, however, you must ensure that all copyright notices in the code are retained. Also, if you intend to use the Gantry Framework in a commercial project, or a template you intend to redistribute in any form, please retain a "Powered by Gantry" logo and link in the backend administrative interface.
