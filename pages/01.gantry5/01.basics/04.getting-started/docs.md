## Installing Gantry 5 and the Helium Theme

Gantry 5 is a framework by which Gantry-powered themes are made. In order for a Gantry theme to work, you will need to install both the **framework** and the **theme**. Doing this is not difficult at all.

The first thing you need to do is download the latest build of Gantry 5 and Helium. You can do so by clicking the buttons below, or via [GitHub](http://github.com/gantry/gantry5).

## What are Outlines, Particles, Atoms, etc.?

Because Gantry 5 is so different from any version of Gantry before it, we came up with some terms to help make sense of the relationships Gantry's new features have with one-another. Here is a quick breakdown of commonly used terms related to Gantry 5.

| Term     | Definition                                                                                                                                             |
| :-----   | :-----                                                                                                                                                 |
| Outline  | A configurable style used in one or more areas of your site. It serves as the container on which a page's style, settings, and layout are set.         |
| Particle | A typically small block of data used on the front end. It acts a lot like a widget/module, but can be easily configured in the Gantry 5 Administrator. |
| Atom     | A type of Particle that contains non-rendered data, such as custom scripting (JS, CSS, etc.) or analytics scripts for traffic tracking.                |

## Diving In and Configuring the Helium Theme

So, you've downloaded the Helium theme and you're ready to edit the content that appears on the front page? We have you covered.

If you're creating a new website from scratch, you are most likely using a RocketLauncher for Joomla or WordPress or a Skeleton for Grav. These are pre-configured editions of Helium that come complete with demo content and particles that are ready for you to edit and configure to your liking.

Once you have the skeleton or RocketLauncher installed, you will notice that there is a lot of content already on the front page. This content is placed within the `Home - Particles` outline.

[ui-tabs position="top-left" active="0"]
[ui-tab title="Joomla"]

![](dive_joomla_1.jpeg?classes=shadow,border)

You can access this outline by navigating to **Components → Gantry 5 Themes** in the administration menu in the back end of Joomla and selecting **Home - Particles** from the outline drop-down. Once you have done that, simply switch to the **Layout** tab and you will see and have access to the particles that make up the front page.

[/ui-tab]
[ui-tab title="WordPress"]

![](dive_wordpress_1.jpeg?classes=shadow,border)

You can access this outline by navigating to **Helium Theme** in the administration menu in the back end of WordPress and selecting **Home - Particles** from the outline drop-down. Once you have done that, simply switch to the **Layout** tab and you will see and have access to the particles that make up the front page.

[/ui-tab]
[ui-tab title="Grav"]

![](dive_grav_1.jpeg?classes=shadow,border)

You can access this outline by navigating to **Gantry 5** in the administration menu in the back end of Grav and selecting **Home - Particles** from the outline drop-down. Once you have done that, simply switch to the **Layout** tab and you will see and have access to the particles that make up the front page.

[/ui-tab]
[/ui-tabs]

This process works for any other outline, including the **Base** outline which is the global default for any page that isn't already assigned to another outline.
