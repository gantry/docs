Gantry 5 is the latest generation of a powerful, flexible open source theming framework currently available for WordPress and Joomla. 

One of the primary goals behind Gantry 5's development has been to make it easier for non-developers to get a lot more done without ever having to open a single code editor or directly alter any files.

In this guide, we will briefly introduce you to what Gantry is, and how it can make managing your site's theme incredibly easy.

## What is a Framework?

If your website is a house, then the content management system (Joomla, WordPress, Grav, etc.) is the foundation. This is where your data is stored and managed. It is the system you use to add content such as posts, articles, pages, images, and more.

The framework is the woodwork that gives your house structure such as walls, windows, doorways, and a roof. It is the tool you use to manage how your theme is applied, when and where content is displayed, and the general layout of your home. In the case of Gantry, the framework is what you interact with on the back end. It gives you the ability to set colors, layouts, and just about any other aspect that affects the way the site looks.

The theme or template is everything else. The trim, paint, door knobs, light fixtures, and pretty much every little detail that gives the house its unique look and feel.

Together, they work together to make your website function, look, and feel exactly as you need it to.

A good framework will give you as close to complete control over your site's visual layout as possible. Virtually everything the user sees outside of the content being served directly from the content management system is managed by the framework.

## Why Gantry?

Gantry 5 was made from the ground up to make life easier for both the developer and the user. Themes made with Gantry 5 share a consistent user experience, reducing the learning curve for both parties. So, whether you are managing one site or fifty, the process for managing your theme is the same no matter how many different themes you use.

Gantry 5 is really easy to use. It has drag-and-drop functionality that enables you to dramatically change the layout of your site in seconds without ever having to even touch your keyboard.

### Particles System

Thanks to Gantry's particles system, the developer can create content blocks for your site that you can add, remove, and update without fear of breaking the site or having to deal with a single line of code. Simple fields and toggle switches make it easy to find and change virtually anything on your site.

This means you can make less calls to the developer for simple changes. Just log in, access the Gantry 5 Administrator, make your changes, and save.

Are you familiar with Joomla's module system? Gantry 5 integrates completely with Joomla so you can continue to use module positions just as you always have. It's super easy to create a new module position in seconds using the Layout Manager and Menu Editor.

### Menu Editor

Gantry 5's Menu Editor is a quick and easy way to non-destructively control the way menus appear on the front end of your site. You can rearrange menu items with drag-and-drop ease, inject particles and more.

Everything you do in Gantry 5 is non-destructive, so your content and menus are left exactly the way they were, so you don't have to worry about doing anything that would disrupt your site's permanent makeup within the Gantry 5 Administrator. 

### Layout Manager

Don't like where something is on the page? Just click and drag it where you want it to go from the Layout Manager. You can add things, remove them, resize them, create module/widget positions, and configure particles without touching the keyboard. 

Things like your logo, copyright information, branding, social icons, and more can also be adjusted directly from the Layout Manager. 

Worried you might get something wrong? You can undo and redo any actions taken in the Layout Manager during that session with a click of the mouse.
